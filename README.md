# ðŸ“Š Project: Complex API 

### Goal: Use data returned from one api to make a request to another api and display the data returned


I completed the challenge: 4
I feel good about my code: 2
No CSS added in the interest of time. Worked with group mate Ernest to complete this API. Will come back to edit styling.
